# Telex
A Telegram Bot based on plugins. 

This bot uses tg and tgl C libraries for its bindings, and we have been contributing our python bindings as we work through it.

Everything is being written for Python 3.4 currently. Everything works in a virtualenv installed and sourced in the launch script.

    git clone https://github.com/datamachine/telex --recursive
    cd telex
    ./launch.sh install
    ./launch.sh

There are not a ton of useful plugins by default, but you can run ``` !pkg update ``` and then ``` !pkg list all ``` to see what plugins are available to install.

Some plugins require admin permissions. You can set an admin in permissions.conf using the followig format

```
[groups]
  admins = <userid#>,<userid#>,<userid#>
```

You can get your user id number by sending the following query to the bot

```
!tginfo id
```

# Notes
While already very capable, this bot is still in relatively early development. Some plugin names, or plugin API calls may be modifed. However, we are starting to settle on our stable APIs.

With that said, we do strive to have the bot continue to function seemlessly when pulling the latest HEAD

# Known Issues

## Not recieving telegram verification text on initial launch

Try running tg directly.

```
$ tg/bin/telegram-cli
```

Once you verify the client, you can stop it and run the launch.sh script again.
